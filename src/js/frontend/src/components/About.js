        <h2>What is the accelerator all about?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A three month programme that takes 2 of the 10 projects created during Hack Brexit weekend.</li>
          <li>Run regular monthly meetings for the teams to present and discuss their projects progress, hosted by ThoughtWorks London.</li>
          <li>Help source additional volunteers to work with the teams on the projects.</li>
          <li>The organising committee will be on hand to provide planning and process assistance over the whole 3 months, and tap into expertise from ThoughtWorks and Code First: Girls community.</li>
          <li>The organising committee will manage external communications for the open source accelerator to help spread the word.</li>
          <li>At the end of 3 months we will run a final external presentation event with external attendees, we will analyse the progress and development of the project along with its future potential for continuing to grow.</li>
          <li>Connect the team members to the wider Hack Brexit meetup community.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
        <p>We want to continue from the success of the Hack Brexit hackathon on the 23-4 July to bring together technical and non-technical people to create tech solutions to drive dialog, unity and positive action beyond Brexit. We want to sustainably support and scale up projects that have a clear positive impact on society and respond to one of the three key themes we chose for the weekend:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Truth, fiction, & accountability;</li>
          <li>Tolerance & prejudice;</li>
          <li>Effective organising & campaigning.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>T&Cs for accelerator projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An open source project publicly available & accessible to all.</li>
          <li>Projects are created in a repository under the Hack Brexit public repository with an MIT License.</li>
          <li>Projects have an IP that is open to all & can be used by anyone.</li>
          <li>Projects speak to one of the three key themes identified at the Hack (Truth, Fiction & Accountability; Tolerance & prejudice; Effective organising & campaigning) or a future theme as agreed by the community.</li>
          <li>Commitment to work with a group of volunteers on the project for a duration of 3 months.</li>
          <li>Work alongside your project team volunteers & the Hack Brexit organisers to plan the outcomes for at least 3 months.</li>
          <li>Be a project that has scope to continue to be worked on by others in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Meetup agenda</h2>
